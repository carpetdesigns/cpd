# Aspire CPD

A single plugin to transform a WordPress Multisite install into a CPD (Continuous Professional Development) management platform. Built in association with The [University of Sheffield](http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/).

[Got an issue? Make sure you report it to us](https://github.com/mkdo/cpd/issues).

## Theme

To get the most out of this plugin you will need to install the companion [Aspire CPD Theme](https://github.com/mkdo/aspire-cpd).

A planned feature of this plugin is to enable the installation of this theme when the plugin is activated.

## Documentation

Documentation is still work in progress, but is shaping [in our Wiki](https://github.com/mkdo/cpd/wiki).

## Credits

We belive in giving credit where credit is due. The following plugins and people helped us get a kick start in delivering this project. Thank you to them!

The foundations of this project are based on the [CPD Journals](http://wordpress.org/plugins/cpd-journals/) WordPress plugin originally by [Saul Cozens](http://saulcozens.co.uk) - licenced under the GPLv2 licence.

The way that new Journals are created with base 'Journal Templates' could not be done without code taken from the [Blog Copier](https://wordpress.org/plugins/blog-copier) WordPress plugin by [MODERN TRIBE](https://tri.be/) - licenced under the GPLv2 licence.

To create metaboxes we use the excelent [Custom Meta Boxes](https://github.com/humanmade/Custom-Meta-Boxes) plugin by [Human Made](https://hmn.md/) - licenced under the GPLv2 licence.

The ability to login with email was done by following examples in the [WP Email Login](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-email-login/) plugin by [Beau Lebans](https://profiles.wordpress.org/beaulebens/), [r-a-y](https://profiles.wordpress.org/r-a-y/) and [andykillen](https://profiles.wordpress.org/andykillen/).

To update the plugin directly from GitHub we use the awesome [WordPress GitHub Plugin Updator](https://github.com/radishconcepts/WordPress-GitHub-Plugin-Updater) by [Radish Concepts](http://www.radishconcepts.com/) - licenced under the GPLv2 licence. We also borrowed heavily from this to allow the associated CPD theme(s) to be updated directly from GitHub also.
